# Taxi_Cab_Prediction_Analysis

# Business Problem/Problem Statement

For a given location in New York City, our goal is to predict the number of pickups in that given location. Some location require more taxis at a particular time than other locations owing to the presence schools, hospitals, offices etc. The prediction result can be transferred to the taxi drivers via Smartphone app, and they can subsequently move to the locations where predicted pickups are high.

# Purpose:
In last few years, it has been observed that number of operating hire vehicles and number of trips in app-based vehicle increased drastically. However, taxi trips have fallen in same proportion in which number of vehicles increased.

The purpose of doing this exercise is two-fold:

To facilitate the cab organisation data centric outcome so that they can provide the optimize overall taxi fare by incorporating the flexibility in some of the fixed cost like waiting time in pickup, drop off and traffic jam along with peak hours.
To increase the Net promoting Score (NPS) by winning the confidence of customers in competitive market which resulted in improving taxi trips.
Roadmap:
The quality of results depends on the data quality and features used for modelling. Given below are the steps, I followed while building the model
